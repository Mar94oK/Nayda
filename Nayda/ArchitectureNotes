/* ==============================
*   CARD IMPLEMENTATION LOGIC
*/ ==============================
As far as card's transporting system is concerned:
1) Each method responsible is unique, since implementation of cards are strongly type-based
and the basis is to small to make the common method for all of them.
2) So, For each card type there SHOULD BE own Implementer method, where card property transportation
is taken place.
3) All the actions with card as property SHOULD take place before animation!!!
4) Generic structure is allways the same:

A) User-initiated
    a1) Check General Restrictions
    a2) Check Implementation allowance
    a3) According to allowance, start Implementer or Report Reason of Restriciton to User
    a4) Start Animation if necessary,
    a5) Report to Server

B) Server-initiated
    b1) Start Implementer Directly. With the only exeception of Armor and Weapon implementations - the
    allowance should be recived to decide whether they are allowed to be ACTIVE on SHOULD BE Incative.
    b2) Start Animation.

*Note 1

Battlefield cards processing MIGHT differ from the explained.
