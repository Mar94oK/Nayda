//Created 02.03.2019
//To define markers where some work is expected to be done later.
//At least, it makes sense to pay attention to them.


EXPECTED_IMPROVEMENT
//Expectation to make the things better. Should be with notes;

HARDCODED_BEHAVIOUR
//Some thing wich expected to be done as non-hard-coded. Rework it!

ARCHITECTURE
//Notes about ARCHITECTURE. Pay attention. There might be some issues.

ADD_LATER
//NECESSARY additions. SHOULD BE added before Munchkin can be released.

REWORK
//The process is WRONG!!!! Rework it. Some approach was taken to be able to work further,
but they BREAKS the Game LOGIC. Therefore REWORK IS NECESSARY!!!

RULE-NOTE
//My assumptions regarding Rules and the algorithm applied.
//May be checked in the list of the RulesNotes
//And, ofcourse, scoped by RULE-NOTE marker.
